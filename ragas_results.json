The Establishment Standards introduce the Procurement Framework and the Procurement Standards as its component and define the purpose, intended use and applicability. They assign responsibility and set the governance mechanism thereof.\n- A2. The  Enablement  Standards  define  attributes  of  functions  and  individuals  practising procurement  and  describe  requirements  for  actors,  relations  and  setup  conditions  to procure efficiently. They introduce the Procurement as a function providing services to the requesting party or End-users.\n- A3. The  Execution  Standards  define  the  way  of  working  and  expected  performance  of  the Procurement with the criteria against which to measure it.

It guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives and aligns procurement activities with Entity strategy and Abu Dhabi Governmental initiatives.\n\nThe 'Procurement Strategy'  is created  with  mid-to-long  term  perspective  and  updated  yearly.  Key elements of value proposition addressed by the 'Procurement Strategy' include (but not limited to):\n\n- a) Increased value to the Entity\n- b) Improved efficiency and effectiveness\n- c) Greater stakeholder alignment\n- d) Enhanced external partnerships\n\nThe Head of Procurement is responsible for the creation of the Procurement Strategy. The Head of Procurement assigns  key  members  from Procurement to  create  and  monitor  execution  of  the 'Procurement Strategy'.\n\nContext: Based on the provided context, it appears that we are discussing a section from an \"Overview\" part of the Procurement Manual (Business Processes)",

Conduct  Spend  analysis  In  addition  to  above, spend  data  is  collated  and  analysed  for additional optimization opportunities. This analysis provides insights into historical spend, Supplier base, and spend categories to identify the focus areas for improvement.\n- c. Conduct Market analysis Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and  conditions  to  assess  their  impact  on  the Procurement .  The  necessary  data  may  be collected  through  primary  and  secondary  sources.  This  data  is  updated  over  time,  to maintain  relevance.  Various  methodologies,  such  as Por ter's  five  forces (industry  rivalry, buyer  power,  Supplier  power,  threat  to  new  entrant,  substitution  possibilities),  TOWS (Threat, Opportunities, Weakness, and Strengths) and PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used."

    "3": "A Full Sourcing Project and a Quick Sourcing Project differ primarily in their complexity, spend amount, and required processes. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Complexity and Spend**:\n   - A Full Sourcing Project is suitable for high-spend strategic initiatives that may require a detailed 'Sourcing Strategy', multiple sourcing events, and separate technical and commercial bid submissions in different envelopes.\n   - A Quick Sourcing Project is appropriate for low-spend non-strategic initiatives where a detailed 'Sourcing Strategy' or multiple sourcing events are not necessary. Bids can be submitted in a single envelope.\n\n2. **Process Flow**:\n   - Full Sourcing Projects involve more complex processes, including the development and review of a 'Sourcing Strategy', multiple sourcing events, and detailed bid submissions.\n   - Quick Sourcing Projects follow simpler processes with fewer steps, such as a single event (RFI, RFQ, or Auction) without requiring a 'Sourcing Strategy'.\n\n3. **Public Tenders**:\n   - Public tenders can only be executed using Full Sourcing Projects.\n\n4. **Negotiations and Contract Workspace**:\n   - Negotiation tasks are enabled in SAP Ariba for Full Sourcing Projects but not necessarily for Quick Sourcing Projects.\n   - The 'Contract Workspace' is created outside the 'Sourcing Project' for Quick Sourcing Projects, while it can be part of the project for Full Sourcing Projects.\n\n5. **Project Types and Process Flows**:\n   - Detailed process flows are illustrated in Figures 2.3.9 and 2.3.10 within the SAP Ariba Procurement Manual.\n   \nFor more detailed information, refer to the SAP Ariba Procurement Manual (Ariba Aligned).md.\n\nSources: \n- Procurement Manual (Ariba Aligned).md",
    "4": "The key steps to develop a 'Procurement Strategy' include:\n\n1. **Conduct Internal and External Analysis**:\n   - Analyze Procurement processes in terms of People, Processes, Technology, and Governance.\n   - Conduct spend analysis to identify historical spend, supplier base, and spend categories for improvement opportunities.\n   - Perform market analysis by assessing the evolution of markets, trends, and conditions using methodologies such as Porter's Five Forces, TOWS (Threats, Opportunities, Weaknesses, Strengths), and PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental).\n\n2. **Develop Vision and Mission**:\n   - Derive the vision and mission of procurement from the entity\u2019s overall vision and mission.\n\n3. **Set Goals and Objectives**:\n   - Based on the analysis done in previous sections, develop clear objectives for procurement that align with the entity's strategy.\n   - Examples include scaling procurement capabilities to enable alignment with the agenda of the entity, promoting MSMEs and Emirati entrepreneurs, and empowering green procurement through awareness and specification enhancement.\n\n4. **Identify Key Initiatives**:\n   - Develop initiatives that are measurable and aligned with the objectives identified in the 'Procurement Strategy'.\n   - These initiatives should focus on delivering process and cost efficiencies, improving governance, and enhancing stakeholder alignment.\n\n5. **Align with Abu Dhabi Governmental Initiatives**:\n   - Ensure that procurement activities align with the broader governmental strategies and initiatives.\n\n6. **Monitor and Review Regularly**:\n   - Implement the strategy while ensuring it is aligned with organizational goals.\n   - Regularly monitor and review the strategy to ensure its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.\n\nSources: \n- Procurement Manual (Ariba Aligned).md\n- Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards.md\n- Procurement Manual (Business Process).md",

This strategy enables consolidation and optimization opportunities, leading to deeper market understanding, increased savings, improved service levels, quality, availability, and value for money, as well as enhanced supplier relationships and reduced supply chain risks.\n\nThe Category Strategy is created periodically, preferably once a year, for all common categories and entity-specific categories contributing to the top 80% of the entity spend. It serves as a strategic approach to procurement, providing actionable insights from internal category profiles and external category analyses. The strategy is shared with relevant stakeholders for execution, and its initiatives are reviewed and approved periodically by the Category Manager or Project Owner.\n\nSources:\n1.
